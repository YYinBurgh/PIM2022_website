                    <p>Successful aging is for all of us! Even as we enter our 20’s, we begin a gradual decline by some measures of ability, cognitive as well as physical, while by other measures of cognitive ability we continue to show improvement as we age into our 60’s and beyond. To be sure, aging, of societies as well as individuals, can bring transition and crisis. To age successfully is to show resilience in the face of age-related declines while taking full advantage of the knowledge and wisdom that come with age. In this 8th in <a href="pimworkshop.org/" target="_blank">a series of workshops</a> -- the third to be offered at ASIS&amp;T -- to discuss issues of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management" target="_blank">personal information management (PIM)</a>, special focus will be given to the ways in which our information and related tools might support us throughout our lives. </p>
                        
                    <p>Online, asynchronous, pre-workshop discussion aims to engage a wide range of researchers and practitioners working in areas related to the workshop theme, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, knowledge management, information behavior, health informatics, and more. The workshop will be full-day, in-person, and followed by a collaborative article detailing current knowledge, gaps, and especially promising directions of future research. Endorsed by ASIS&amp;T Special Interest Groups <a href="https://www.asist.org/SIG/SIGKM/" target="_blank">SIG-KM</a> and <a href="https://www.asist.org/SIG/SIGUSE/" target="_blank">SIG-USE</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Objectives</h2>
                        
                        <p>We encourage submissions that consider research and direct experience relating to roles that information and information tools might play in successful aging:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How can information tools support us better as we age?</strong> We consider tools that reduce demands on facilities such as working memory, which is shown to decline gradually with normal aging beginning as early as when a person turns 20, while possibly increasing reliance on facilities such as vocabulary and general world knowledge, which improve steadily with normal aging. The broad perspective of PIM encourages a consideration of tools that integrate across functions such as journaling and task/to-do list management to provide support for both episodic and prospective memory, both shown to decline with normal aging. This perspective also considers tools of health informatics to support the tracking and interpretability of measures relating to our health and well-being.</li>
                            <li><strong>What can we do, right now?</strong>...in the organization of our information and our choice of information tools towards more successful aging? Considerations include long-term collection planning, deliberate training to proficiency in tools and techniques of PIM, and development, through subscriptions and personal relationships, of information channels.</li>
                            <li><strong>What methods scale?</strong>...for the exploration and validation of information tools and techniques in support of successful aging? We must consider not only how well people are doing now (across tools and different forms of information) but also how well they will do over the long run. Might some methods scale to be “massive, open and on-line” in ways that support the voluntary participation of a large and diverse number of people?</li>
                            <li><strong>What about policies and regulations?</strong> In addition, we consider corporate policies and governmental regulations that might better support SA. What support is needed, for example, to ensure format interoperability so that information itself can “successfully age” for use in newer tools? Also relevant are measures to encourage greater age diversity in workplace teams where, as with other forms of diversity, this is seen not only as “the proper thing to do” but also as advantageous for all concerned.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>From the workshop will follow an article reviewing the state of our knowledge with respect to the use of information and information tools in successful aging and serving as a call to action towards further research and development.</p>

                        <p><strong>All who are interested in participating (online or in-person), should submit a one- to two-thousand-word position statement</strong> via <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/PIM2022" target="_blank">EasyChair</a> (1-to 4-page, excluding references, preferably in APA format, written in English, PDF or MS Word) describing their position and work they are doing as this relates to the workshop theme and objectives.
