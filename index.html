                        </br>
                        <p>Successful aging is for all of us! Even as we enter our 20’s, we begin a gradual decline by some measures of ability, cognitive as well as physical, while by other measures of cognitive ability we continue to show improvement as we age into our 60’s and beyond. To be sure, aging, of societies as well as individuals, can bring transition and crisis. To age successfully is to show resilience in the face of age-related declines while taking full advantage of the knowledge and wisdom that come with age. In this 8th in a series of workshops to discuss issues of personal information management (PIM)  -- the third to be offered at ASIS&amp;T -- special focus will be given to the ways in which our information and related tools might support us throughout our lives. </p>
                        
                        <p>Online, asynchronous, pre-workshop discussion aims to engage a wide range of researchers and practitioners involved in work relating to the workshop theme.  The actual workshop will be full-day (8 hours), in-person, and will be followed by the publication of a collaborative article detailing current knowledge (and gaps) and especially promising directions of future research. Endorsed by  ASIS&amp;T <a href="https://www.asist.org/SIG/SIGKM/" target="_blank">SIG-KM</a> and <a href="https://www.asist.org/SIG/SIGUSE/" target="_blank">SIG-USE</a>.</p>
